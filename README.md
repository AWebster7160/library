# library
Library project focusing on object / object construction

2/8/2024- Small library page to add and display books with toggle to mark as read or unread

2/9/2024- Satisfied with having working constructor function and library index methods. First time calling calling for parentNode id in order to display:none the parent container of the delete button. Also first time using @keyframes in css, will likely continue to use animation api in JS as it's easier to assign animations to event listeners like mouseout
